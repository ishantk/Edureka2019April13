Computer -> Which can compute !!
10 * 20 = 200

465412341 * 764544321 = ?

	Challenges for Human when it comes to computation !!
	1. Time
	2. Accuracy 

	We can address above challenges using Computer

	Computer - Hardware + Software

	We are into Softwares
		1. Operating System
		2. System Software
			which runs in the OS
		3. Application Software
			Which runs on top of OS


	Software : Which will solve a problem !!
			   eg : Uber, WhatsApp, Zomato/Swiggy, Amazon

			   Problem:	1. MODEL 		-> Data
			   		    2. CONTROLLER 	-> Logic
			   		    3. VIEW			-> interfaces where we get the data and show the data in SW

			   MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER (MVC Design Pattern)		    

			   Uber	: Booking a Cab
			   			1. Data
			   				source location
			   				destinition location
			   				type of cab
			   				payment method
			   			2. Logic
			   				find nearest driver
			   				show time to reach for driver to place from where cab is booked
			   				show arrival time to destinition once picked up
			   				finding shortest path with least traffic
			   			3. User Interface in the form of Mobile UI	

			   	We need a Programming Language to create MODEL VIEW and CONTROLLER !!
			   	Programming language unlike any other language eg: French shall have dictionary and Grammar

			   	Keywords					    
			   	Syntax

			   	We choose PL based on its features and the kind of Software which we have to develop !!

			   	eg: to create an OS we shall use C and C++
			   		to create a System SW again C and C++
			   		to create an Application SW we can use : C++, Java, Python, C#, Kotlin, Dart .....


			   	System Setup for Java Programming
			   	
			   	1. JDK Installation
			   		Java Development Kit
			   		Contains some tools like compiler, interpreter, documentation tools
			   		Contains Built In Codes from which we can create our softwares

			   	2. Setup the Path of JDK in your System
			   	PS: open Command Prompt / terminal and type in java -version
			   	
			   	3. Install Eclipse EE
			   		IDE : Integrated Development Environment
			   		SW which we will use to create a SW	


			   	--------------------------------------
			   	Orange Juice and Software Development

				--------------------------------------
			   	Oranges 			Source

			   	Juicer 				Process Source

			   	Liquid Juice 		Result

			   	Pack it

			   	Glass \_/			End Result	

			   	--------------------------------------
			   	MyApp.cpp 			Source Code | High Level Language
			   					    contains commands and instructions written in that language

			   	Compiler 			Process Source 
			   	

			   	MyApp.obj 			Object Code	| Low Level Language			    

			   	Pack It

		W	   	MyApp.exe 			Executable Code | Executed on Windows OS
		M       MyApp.dmg
		L 		MyApp.sh

				--------------------------------------

				MyApp.java 			Source Code | High Level Language

				Compiler

				MyApp.class 		ByteCode in Java

				Thats It !!

				--------------------------------------

				JDK
					Java Development Kit
					It contains built in code for us
					It contains Compiler
					It also contains various tools required for development purpose

				JRE
					Java Runtime Environment
					JRE is installed automatically alongwith JDK
					JRE helps to load bytecodes to JVM	

				JVM
					Java Virtual Machine
					is pre installed in all the desktop OS's
					It executes Bytecodes for us



					MODEL 		
						Represents data for Software
						In order to store data we have storage containers (RAM)
						1. Single Value Containers | Primitive Data Types
						2. Multi value Container
							2.1 homogeneous
							2.2 hetrogeneous

					VIEW
					CONTROLLER
